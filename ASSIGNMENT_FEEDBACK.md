Hi Nisha.

In these feedback forms, I try to give constructive criticism and offer some suggstions, but I really can't find anything to say here. This is excellent and easily a Välgodkänt level.

You have clearly shown you have a good understanding of html and css and delivered exactly what was required with very well organised and easy to read code. 10/10.
